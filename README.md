Hi, I’m @reillymc

I’m a full-stack software developer from Australia, now based in the UK. I’m passionate about building software that is architected cleanly, delivers great user experiences amd solves real-world problems.

I’m also a strong proponent of open source, and enjoy tinkering with linux, my homelab and probably too many hobby projects.
