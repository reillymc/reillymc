Hi, I’m @reillymc

I’m a full-stack software developer from Australia, now based in the UK. I’m passionate about building software that delivers great user experiences, solves real-world problems, and is architected cleanly.

I enjoy working on mobile and web frontends, with most of my professional experience focused on React, and React Native used for hobby projects such as [Framerate](https://github.com/reillymc/Framerate) and [Lamington](https://github.com/reillymc/Lamington). I’ve also explored other frameworks and tools, including Xamarin/.NET MAUI for [Groundsman](https://github.com/reillymc/Groundsman) and SwiftUI for [Project Unleaded](https://github.com/reillymc/Project-Unleaded).

Working on backends alongside frontends gives me variety and the chance to tackle different types of challenges. I’ve primarily used .NET (C#) professionally and Node (TypeScript) for hobby projects like [Lamington (backend)](https://github.com/reillymc/Lamington-Server). Recently, I’ve challenged myself to learn Rust for my latest project, [Framerate (backend)](https://github.com/reillymc/Framerate-Backend).

In addition to my own projects, I’m a strong supporter of open source and am actively working to contribute more where I can. So far, I’ve made contributions to projects such as [Navidrome](https://github.com/navidrome/navidrome) and [Amperfy](https://github.com/BLeeEZ/amperfy), and I’m always looking for opportunities to collaborate.
